/* Maximum Gap
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a7893ef0025e9eb50000013
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find The maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives and negatives also zeros_

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

The Maximum Gap is computed Regardless the sign.

Input >> Output Examples
maxGap ({13,10,5,2,9}) ==> return (4)
Explanation:
The Maximum Gap after sorting the array is 4 , The difference between 9 - 5 = 4 .
maxGap ({-3,-27,-4,-2}) ==> return (23)
Explanation:
The Maximum Gap after sorting the array is 23 , The difference between  |-4- (-27) | = 23 .

Note : Regardless the sign of negativity .

maxGap ({-7,-42,-809,-14,-12}) ==> return (767)  
Explanation:
The Maximum Gap after sorting the array is 767 , The difference between  | -809- (-42) | = 767 .

Note : Regardless the sign of negativity .

maxGap ({-54,37,0,64,640,0,-15}) //return (576)
Explanation:
The Maximum Gap after sorting the array is 576 , The difference between  | 64 - 640 | = 576 .

Note : Regardless the sign of negativity .*/
