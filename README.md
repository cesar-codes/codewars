Codewars Katas and solutions. 

![alt rank](https://www.codewars.com/users/cesaravina/badges/large)

I have solved over 500 Codewars Katas (challenges) and push my solutions to GitHub every day. 

My solutions are organized by challenge difficulty from 8 Kyu (easiest) to 1 Kyu (hardest).

###### Codewarriors: You are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata challenges until you have completed it yourselves or at least took the time to think about your own approaches to the challenge.

###### Codewarriors should not submit any of my solutions as their own.

###### I do not accept any contributions of any form to this repo.

###### Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars.
